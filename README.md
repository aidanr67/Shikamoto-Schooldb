1. Copy the Web file to your Apache directory (/var/www/ or /var/www/html/ usually).
2. Put the dbpass.txt file once branch up from the Apache directory (/var/ or /var/www/ for above) so that it is not public.

To change the database password, change it in dbpass.txt.
To change username, database name, etc. see config.php
